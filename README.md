# Neural-Network-with-multiple-Hidden-Layers
Continued from my other repository, this contains neural network coded in tesorflow framework with multiple hidden layers
Neural Networks with multiple hidden layers using tensorflow framework.

Tensor flow frame work is used here. If you have doubts related to the code, please raise an issue. Doubts related to tensor flow code can be directed to its github repository here: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow

Highly inspired from Andrew NG's Coursera Deep Learning Course.
